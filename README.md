## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
2. Fill out the form — all required fields are marked.
3. Submit button at bottom (no actual submission — for demo only).

> 💡 Tip: Try resizing your browser window — the form stays readable on small screens!

## 📈 Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add JavaScript for custom validation (e.g., phone number format, date range).
- Connect to a backend (PHP/Node.js) to save data.
- Add a print stylesheet for clinic use.
- Implement CAPTCHA or security features for live deployment.
- Convert to React/Vue component for dynamic apps.
